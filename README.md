This offline-capable web app can graph CSV or JSON files easily, and offers chart exporting and customization. It can perform some grouping actions on the fly with sums, means and medians.

This project was used to test Vite + Vue 3, with `<script setup>` and Composition API, as well as [VueI18N](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/) for localization, [pinia](https://github.com/posva/pinia) as a Store, and [unplugin-icons](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-icons) for the icons.
